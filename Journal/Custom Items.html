  "material": "Polished volcanic obsidian",
  "description": "A small, flat obsidian coin etched with a slit-pupil eye. Used by Iron Meridian covert agents as a mark of favor, training, or silent recognition. Said to originate from an old Nightwatcher sect, or possibly something far older and watchful.",
  "traits": ["Invested", "Social", "Symbolic"],
  "effect": [
    "Functions as a badge of recognition among underground networks affiliated with the Iron Meridian.",
    "Once per session, grants a +1 circumstance bonus to a Stealth or Deception check in an urban environment when used as a signal or proof of identity (GM's discretion).",
    "Can be shown to certain NPCs to unlock secret dialogue, access, or missions."
  ],
  "lore": [
    "Known among covert Iron Meridian operatives as a 'Cloakmark'.",

  "description": "A thick, geometric rug of ancient dwarven make, woven from deepvault wool and reinforced hide. The pattern includes interlocking chevrons and subtle knotwork, possibly encoded with clan secrets. It bears the signs of age and once-hidden metallic threading.",
  "traits": ["Cultural", "Heirloom", "Encoded"],
  "lore": [
    "The style is associated with the Stonebind Clan, believed wiped out in a siege-collapse nearly 200 years ago.",

    "May contain elemental resonance from centuries near a dwarven forge."
  ],
  "effect": [
    "No magical effect in current state.",
    "May be deciphered via Crafting, Dwarven Lore, or Engineering Lore (DC 17) to reveal deeper purpose.",
    "Could serve as a focus in future dwarven rituals, forgework, or restoration magic.",
    "If properly restored or enchanted, it may become a functional magical item or ritual focus."
  ],
  "hooks": [
    "Detect Magic currently yields no aura â€” but this may change with restoration or reactivation.",
