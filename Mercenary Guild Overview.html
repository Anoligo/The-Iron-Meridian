  <h1>The Iron Meridian - Guild Overview</h1>

<div class="section">
  <h2>✨ World Background Summary</h2>
  <p><strong>Current Year:</strong> 2050 AD (After Divide)</p>
  <p>
    About 4000 years ago, a dying god decided to pull the world apart like poorly baked bread.
    That event — now just called “The Divide” — kicked off millennia of monsters, magical fallout, 
    and the general collapse of polite society.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since then, the world’s been through *a lot*: undead empires, dragon kings with ego problems, 
    and most recently, a charming little apocalypse called <em>The Harrowing</em>, which left glowing rift portals 
    scattered like confetti (except, you know, screaming and demonic).
  </p>
  <p>
    The old powers have faded or vanished. Kingdoms are dust. Heroes are few. But mercenaries? 
    Oh, we've got mercenaries. That’s where you come in.
  </p>
  <p>
    Your guild — <strong>The Iron Meridian</strong> — is one of the few standing between this broken world and 
    complete demon buffet. Based out of an old fortress with new plumbing, you take contracts, 
    fight monsters, and occasionally argue about who gets the magic boots.
  </p>

  <h2>🏰 The Iron Meridian – Structure & Rules</h2>

  <p><strong>Location:</strong><br>
  A sturdy keep perched on old bones — pre-Divide ruins, demon-scarred lands, and cheap rent. What could go wrong?</p>

  <p><strong>Mission Access:</strong><br>
  We’ll recommend a rank. That won’t stop a troll from turning you into a hat. Consider it advice, not armour.</p>

  <p><strong>Loot:</strong><br>
  “From spoils to stockpiles!” All loot can be offered to the Guild Armoury for appraisal — in return for gold. Honest rates, mostly. (Don’t ask about the ‘missing’ Wand of Fireballs.)</p>

  <p><strong>Training:</strong><br>
  Those who train, maintain. Miss a mission? No problem — the Away Training program ensures you come back older, wiser, and only <em>slightly</em> rusty.</p>

  <p><strong>Guild Flow:</strong><br>
  Due to the unpredictable nature of questing, the Iron Meridian operates a ‘rotational adventuring model.’ That’s code for: sometimes folks are off fighting things you haven’t even heard of yet. Welcome them back like they never left (and maybe ask if they brought snacks)..</p>

<h3>🌟 Rank Structure</h3>
<table>
  <tr><th>Rank</th><th>Level Range</th><th>Privileges</th></tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Bronze</td>
    <td>1–3</td>
    <td>
      Welcome to the grind. Expect goblins, rats, and "character building" jobs.
      Payouts are modest, but hey — the tavern has a discount stew night.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Silver</td>
    <td>4–7</td>
    <td>
      You're starting to shine. Bigger missions, better gear, and the occasional 
      "oops-that-was-a-dragon" moment. Also includes a semi-official badge.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Gold</td>
    <td>8–12</td>
    <td>
      Now we're talking. Elite contracts, rare loot drops, and probably a 
      moral dilemma or two. People might even start calling you “hero” unironically.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Platinum</td>
    <td>13+</td>
    <td>
      You're on the poster. These missions could shift the fate of continents 
      (or at least cities). Top-tier pay, special privileges, and enemies with monologues.
    </td>
  </tr>

    <h2>🥇 Guild Rewards & Away Progression</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>XP:</strong> Join a mission, earn your share of glory and XP. Away for a session? No problem. You’ll receive the average XP from active runs—whether you were off training, undercover, or on a suspiciously long lunch break, we don’t ask.</li>
  <li><strong>Merits:</strong> Earned for going above and beyond—like saving the day or just not blowing up the healer. Trade them in for perks, upgrades, and bragging rights in the mess hall.</li>
</ul>

    <h3>🏦 Guild Armoury</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Loot turned in to the Armoury gets appraised and exchanged for gold at a generous 1:1 rate—no haggling, no headaches, just honest coin for your goblin-stained sword.</li>
  <li>Need gear but low on coin? Rent it for the session at just 20% of the market price. But remember: if you break it, you *definitely* bought it.</li>
  <li>Gear rotates between missions—our NPC mercs have sticky fingers and wanderlust. Don’t get too attached to that +1 spear; it might be stabbing a demon in another district next week.</li>
  <li>Some items vanish permanently from the Armoury (and no, we don’t want to talk about where that flaming crossbow went). If it's gone, it’s gone.</li>
</ul>

    <h2>🌎 Factions</h2>
<table>
  <tr><th>Faction</th><th>Type</th><th>Attitude to Guild</th><th>Notes</th></tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Pale Paladins</td>
    <td>Military/Religious</td>
    <td>Cautiously Allied</td>
    <td>Big fans of order, honor, and scowling. Will bless your sword *and* judge your lifestyle.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Radiant Crusaders</td>
    <td>Adventurer Guild</td>
    <td>Friendly Competitors</td>
    <td>Flashy, loud, and usually on fire—in the heroic way. Expect rivalry with a handshake (and maybe fireworks).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Dismal Blades</td>
    <td>Criminal</td>
    <td>Neutral to Hostile</td>
    <td>Will stab you in the back… but might pay well first. Shady jobs, shady folks.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Ivory Labyrinth Templars</td>
    <td>Cult</td>
    <td>Hostile</td>
    <td>Terrible party guests. Speak in riddles, summon things with too many eyes, and never tip.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Demonic Forces</td>
    <td>Enemies</td>
    <td>Kill on Sight</td>
    <td>They’re why we can’t have nice things. Expect fire, portals, and unreasonable roaring.</td>

    <h2>🏛️ Modular Mission Structure</h2>
    <p>Each game session can focus on a mission from:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>External contracts (towns, nobles, trade routes)</li>
      <li>Internal guild needs (demon incursions, training drills)</li>
      <li>Faction intrigue (covert tasks, diplomacy)</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="note">Missions vary in length and challenge — pick what fits the time and group mood.</p>
