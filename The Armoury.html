    <h1>The Armoury (No, Not the Room — the People)</h1>

  <p>You'd be forgiven for thinking "The Armoury" was just a locked door full of swords. In reality, <strong>The Armoury</strong> is a motley crew of eccentric experts who keep The Iron Meridian ticking, stocked, and sometimes gently exploding. You spend your Gold with <em>them</em> — and yes, they all have their own price tags and policies. Try not to insult the brew.</p>

    <p>A grizzled veteran of a dozen wars and twice as many barroom brawls, Branna runs the core supply hub. She's got a ledger thicker than a troll's skull and a memory like a steel trap. "You break it, you bought it. You bleed on it, you're buying me a drink." That's her motto.</p>

  <h2>🏋️ Training Options</h2>
  <p>Whether you're sharpening your mind, honing your body, or just trying to survive your next tavern brawl — the Guild offers advanced training options for those with gold to burn and fate to tempt.</p>

  <div class="npc">
  <h3>Option A: Random Quirk™ Training</h3>
  <p>
    Feeling bold? Embrace the chaos! This training grants a random <strong>Quirk™</strong> — a passive, ability, or trait that adds a twist to your character. You’ll roll up <strong>two options</strong> and pick one to keep forever (probably). 
  </p>
  <p>
    To begin, you must choose a trainer from the guild’s roster of NPCs. Your Quirk™ will be inspired by that trainer’s skills, background, or general weirdness — so choose wisely (or recklessly).
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Cost:</strong> 100,000 Gold × (Current Quirks + 1)</li>
    <li><strong>Bonus:</strong> Each quirk is unique and permanent. Could be awesome. Could be weird. Definitely memorable.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

  <div class="npc">
    <h3>Option B: Skill Specialisation</h3>
    <p>
      Prefer steady improvement over wild surprises? This focused training lets you increase a skill of your choice — become a master of sneaking, convincing, deciphering, or whatever it is you do best.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Cost:</strong> 5,000 Gold × (Current Skill Rank + 1)</li>
      <li><strong>Effect:</strong> Increase one skill rank. Cannot exceed normal limits without GM approval (or creative bribery).</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <p><em>Note: All training must be registered with Instructor Yari Thorne. Side effects of Random Quirks™ may include laughter, confusion, plot twists, and mysterious tattoos.</em></p>
</div>

<h2>How The Armoury Works</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong class="highlight">Stock Rotates:</strong> Today’s magic ring is tomorrow’s breakfast incident.</li>
    <li><strong class="highlight">They Gossip:</strong> Don’t do anything stupid. If you do — make it funny.</li>
    <li><strong class="highlight">Not a Shop:</strong> They’re people, not shelves. Treat them well or pay the “idiot tax.”</li>
  </ul>
