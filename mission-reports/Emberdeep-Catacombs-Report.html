  <h1 style="text-align: center; color: #4b2c20;">📜 Iron Meridian - Mission Report</h1>

  <h2>Mission:</h2>
  <p>🕯️ <em>Emberdeep Catacombs</em></p>

  <h2>Participants:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Ecaon</li>
    <li>ObsidianIvy</li>
    <li>Styx Red-Claw</li>
    <li>Buggie</li>
    <li>Vokkar</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Summary:</h2>
  <p>The team answered the call of Grigg Ironkeg, innkeeper of the Emberdeep Tavern, after a mysterious quake opened a long-forgotten rune-sealed door beneath the cellar. Whispers in the night, ghostly rattlings, and the legacy of a vanished alchemist drew the party into the depths of the Ironkeg family's buried secrets.</p>

  <p><strong>Highlights include:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Buggie attempted diplomacy with rats... then obliterated them with a caustic blast.</li>
    <li>The party braved echoing halls and skeletal ambushes, solving a runic puzzle with wit and agility.</li>
    <li>Room by room, they uncovered ancient lore, surviving traps, and cryptic inscriptions — including a parchment bearing Serelith's oath.</li>
    <li>Vokkar pranked Buggie by sealing them in a sarcophagus (they survived — barely — and with excellent comedic timing).</li>
    <li>In the Hall of Whispers, a clever push of a stone tongue silenced haunting voices.</li>
    <li>The Echo Gem was found... then promptly overwritten with a suspiciously accurate fart noise.</li>
    <li>ObsidianIvy expertly solved a constellation puzzle, granting the party access to a treasure vault (and a stylish astrolabe).</li>
    <li>In the Alchemical Workshop, the group destroyed a mutating golem by disrupting the summoning circle and salvaged powerful reagents.</li>
    <li>In the final confrontation, the party used Serelith’s Locket in an improvised spiritual transfer: placing it around Laslo’s neck (ObsidianIvy’s familiar), performing the ritual, and successfully drawing Serelith's soul into the creature. They then safely recalled Laslo into ObsidianIvy’s arm tattoo, causing the locket to crack and fall inert. The haunting ceased.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Outcome:</h2>
  <p>Disturbance beneath Emberdeep Tavern ended. Ghostly manifestations ceased. Spirit of Serelith laid to rest. Tavern structural integrity restored. Grigg moved to tears.</p>

  <h2>Reward:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>💰 50 gp each + bonus loot and relics</li>
    <li>🍷 One month of free drinks at the Emberdeep Tavern</li>
    <li>💎 Unique magic items: Echo Gem (flatulence edition), assorted scrolls, and potions</li>
    <li>📚 Significant Lore: Soulcraft rituals, Ironkeg legacy</li>
    <li>🌟 XP Awarded: 680 XP per adventurer</li>
  </ul>

    “You performed a full soul transfer using a bat, a tattoo, and a cracked heirloom? And sealed a dwarven spirit midair without setting yourselves on fire? That’s what I call Iron Meridian innovation. Just... maybe don’t submit the Echo Gem for future missions.”
