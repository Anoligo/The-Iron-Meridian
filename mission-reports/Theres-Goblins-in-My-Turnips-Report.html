  <h2>Mission:</h2>
  <p>🪓 <em>There's Goblins in My Turnips!</em></p>

  <h2>Participants:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Buggie</li>
    <li>Vokkar</li>
    <li>Styx Red-Claw</li>
    <li>ObsidianIvy</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Summary:</h2>
  <p>The team responded to Old Tom's panicked (and very loud) request for help. After speaking to Tom — and confirming yes, he meant literal goblins in literal hats — the party learned they were holed up in an adjoining field.</p>

  <p>In a bold tactical move, Vokkar agreed to throw Buggie over the hedge for reconnaissance. The attempt was... technically successful, though several turnips may disagree.</p>

  <p>Choosing speed over subtlety, the group charged into the fields. Hidden goblins ambushed them. Buggie attempted to calm a goblin by offering it a strawberry — which the goblin devoured happily — before being immediately slain by an ally mid-bite.</p>

  <p>ObsidianIvy joined the chaos by telekinetically launching a wheelbarrow into another goblin. General goblin-related mayhem ensued. After clearing the field, they found a series of crude trenches and tunnels.</p>

  <p>Using ObsidianIvy's bat familiar to scout ahead (to limited effect), Vokkar heroically charged forward — and immediately triggered an explosive trap. Loud and slightly scorched, he pressed on, only for goblin alchemists to ambush the group with explosive potions.</p>

  <p>Undeterred (and slightly singed), the party crushed the sappers and advanced to the goblins' makeshift "stronghold": turnip crates stacked like barricades. Setting the defenses on fire (and the field, a little), they cleared the trench of defenders.</p>

  <p>After a short rest behind a hasty barricade, they baited the goblin king’s elite guards into caltrops and dealt with them decisively. Finally, the self-proclaimed King Crownie emerged — only to be immediately blinded by ObsidianIvy’s magic, leaving him wildly swinging at shadows until the group finished the job.</p>

  <p>Among the king’s “treasures,” the party found a note containing strange runes. With help from <em>The Armoury</em>, they managed to partially translate it. The fragment mentions “Trial Report: Subject Cluster #3. Behavioural influence confirmed.”</p>

  <p>Needless to say, there’s more going on here than stolen vegetables...</p>

  <h2>Next Steps:</h2>
  <p>Investigate the cryptic document and its connection to “Subject Cluster #3.” Further guidance pending from Guild leadership and the Archivist's Circle.</p>
