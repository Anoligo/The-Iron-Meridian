  <h2>Mission:</h2>
  <p>🎭 <em>The Argent Masquerade (Ashminster Highcourt)</em> — Infiltration & Asset Protection</p>

  <h2>Participants:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Vokkar</li>
    <li>ObsidianIvy (with familiar, Laszlo)</li>
    <li>Ecaon</li>
    <li>Vexara</li>
    <li>Nyx</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Summary:</h2>
  <p>
    Operatives infiltrated the <em>Ashminster Highcourt</em> gala to unmask an Ivory Labyrinth agent and safeguard the relic known as the
    <strong>Heart of the Highcourt</strong>. Entry was achieved via distraction (Vexara’s impromptu “musician” routine) and concealment, after which the team mapped guest movements, cross-checked a stolen guest list, and eavesdropped on whispers surrounding a suspicious <strong>Cask 17</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    A paralytic wine plot was uncovered in the cellars; ObsidianIvy proved the recipe by identifying components and carving a stabilizing rune to revive a “test subject” (Vokkar) after a deliberate feint. Evidence pointed first to poet <strong>Seren Kesh</strong>, who confessed under duress that his family had been taken and he’d been forced to dose the wine. Pursuit led to a secret vault where <strong>Valerius</strong> revealed himself as the true agent, supported by unseen templars.
  </p>
  <p>
    Valerius attempted to bargain for the Heart, then escalated—deploying a crystalline prism to dominate Ecaon. Vokkar severed the control; the templars were brought down; Valerius was captured alive. The team secured the Heart and staged the scene for misdirection during exfiltration.
  </p>

  <h2>Highlights:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Covert Entry:</strong> Vexara’s gate performance distracted guards while the squad slipped inside under invisibility.</li>
    <li><strong>Paper Trail:</strong> Guest list cross-check in the library; handwriting sample from Seren’s poem did <em>not</em> match the ritual book.</li>
    <li><strong>Cask 17:</strong> Cellar workers grumbled; testing confirmed a masquerade sleep draught in the vintage—labels swapped and cask neutralized.</li>
    <li><strong>Hedge & Stables:</strong> Seren went missing; tracked and taken without raising the ballroom alarm.</li>
    <li><strong>The Vault:</strong> Valerius unmasked; invisible templars engaged; <em>Mind-Control Prism</em> shattered when Vokkar removed the wielder’s hand (cleanly, even).</li>
    <li><strong>Extraction:</strong> Heart secured; Captain Jorn silenced to protect the operation; exit executed without public panic.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Outcome:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Ivory Labyrinth operation at the Highcourt exposed and <strong>thwarted</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong>Seren Kesh</strong>Seren Kesh turned over to Ashminster authorities as a coerced pawn. For now he remains under guard, awaiting judgment — though the Guild has pledged to aid him in recovering his family, should the chance arise.</li>
    <li><strong>Valerius</strong> captured alive for interrogation.</li>
    <li><strong>Heart of the Highcourt</strong> retrieved and transferred to Guild custody.</li>
    <li>House security compromised but contained; civilian casualties <em>avoided</em>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Loot & Notable Items:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Heart of the Highcourt:</strong> Crystalline relic attuned to the ambitions/desires of nearby minds.</li>
    <li><strong>Masquerade Sleep Draught Recipe:</strong> Formula and cellar notes for a paralytic wine-dosing potion.</li>
    <li><strong>Mind-Control Prism (shattered):</strong> Crystalline focus formerly used for short-term domination.</li>
  </ul>

<h2>Reward:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>💰 1000g distributed among participants</li>
  <li>🏛 Political Leverage: secured discreet favor with Lord Renn, a notorious but well-connected drunkard, who remembers the operatives all too fondly from the gala</li>
</ul>


  <h2>Next Steps:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Interrogate Valerius (network, handlers, <em>Host cells inside the Highcourt</em>).</li>
    <li>Locate and secure Seren Kesh’s family; evaluate amnesty terms.</li>
    <li>Heart of the Highcourt: full appraisal, warding, and ethics review under Solen Telvair.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 style="color: #5c3824;">Guildmaster’s Comment:</h2>
  <blockquote style="border-left: 4px solid #5c3824; margin: 1em; padding-left: 1em; font-style: italic;">
    “Masks hide faces; coin hides motives. You tore through both without lighting the ballroom on fire—commendable restraint.
    Valerius breathes, the Heart is ours, and Ashminster still thinks it was a splendid evening. That’s a win in three languages.
    Debrief at dawn. Wear something less shiny.”
