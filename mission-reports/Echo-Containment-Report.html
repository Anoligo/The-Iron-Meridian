  <h1 style="text-align: center; color: #4b2c20;">📜 Iron Meridian - Mission Report</h1>

  <h2>Mission:</h2>
  <p>🧠 <em>Guild Priority: Echo Containment (Outpost Theta)</em></p>

  <h2>Participants:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Buggie</li>
    <li>Ecaon</li>
    <li>ElderDan</li>
    <li>Vokkar</li>
    <li>Styx-Red-Claw</li>
    <li>ObsidianIvy</li>
    <li>Tink-Tonk the Cogsmith <em>(Fallen in action)</em></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Summary:</h2>
  <p>
    The team infiltrated the Ivory Labyrinth’s re-education hub in the Ashminster Verge and disabled the
    <em>Mnemosyne Relay</em>, halting a psychic broadcast that was hollowing minds for demonic ingress. High Templar Hylas
    was captured alive. Archivist Dalia and multiple civilians were freed from harmonic control. The victory came at a cost:
    <strong>Tink-Tonk</strong> fell during the final push, his last instructions enabling the relay’s destruction.
  </p>

  <h2>Highlights:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Covert Entry:</strong> A hidden service tunnel let the team bypass the main gate patrols.</li>
    <li><strong>Runic Lock:</strong> ObsidianIvy’s “accidental” pipe alignment revealed the solution path; the door yielded.</li>
    <li><strong>Psychic Construct:</strong> Tink-Tonk spotted a leg-joint weakness; Vokkar bowled it over; a coordinated finish by Vokkar and Styx ended the threat.</li>
    <li><strong>Echo Chamber:</strong> Harmonic haze navigated; Archivist Dalia roused; Lazslo helped escort civilians out.</li>
    <li><strong>Beacon Room:</strong> The relay’s pulse turned half the party on Tink-Tonk under Hylas’s command. With his final breath, he shouted the weak point—“the crystal core.” The team shattered it, dropping Hylas and freeing allies.</li>
    <li><strong>Aftermath:</strong> Hylas taken prisoner; civilians recovered; Tink-Tonk’s body borne home with honors.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Outcome:</h2>
  <p>Outpost Theta neutralized; Mnemosyne Relay destroyed; psychic pressure in the Verge subsided within minutes. Hylas secured for interrogation. Civilians and Archivist Dalia stabilized. Guild success—<em>with loss</em>.</p>

  <h2>Reward:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>💰 1600 gp </li>
    <li>📚 <em>Psionic Archive Tier I</em> access (Occultism +1 vs. Aberrations/psychic topics while referencing the stacks)</li>
    <li>🗡️ Hylas’s Blade — +1 Striking Bastard Sword (grim, black styling)</li>
    <li>🛡️ Mind-Shielding Amulet ×2 — +1 item bonus to Will saves vs. mental (invested)</li>
    <li>🔧 Ethereal Capacitor (spent; 25 gp as components if sold)</li>
    <li>🎧 Aural Dampeners ×4 (reusable guild issue)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Next Steps:</h2>
  <p>Interrogate Hylas; trace supply and signal lines for other relay nodes; prioritize counter-operations under <em>Operation Iron Veil</em>. Armoury to audit and archive Tink-Tonk’s designs.</p>

  <h2 style="color: #5c3824;">Guildmaster’s Comment:</h2>
  <blockquote style="border-left: 4px solid #5c3824; margin: 1em; padding-left: 1em; font-style: italic;">
    “You did more than asked. The beacon is dead, the High Templar breathes Guild air in chains. That’s a win. But this—this was not in the plan.
    Tink-Tonk was a menace and a marvel. He liked working with you. He trusted you. We’ll give him a proper send-off. Rest now. Tomorrow, the war resumes.”
