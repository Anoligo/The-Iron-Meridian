  <h2>Squad:</h2>
  <p><strong>The Ashen Blades</strong> (Silver Rank)</p>
  <ul>

    <li>Korr Blacktusk — Vanguard Greatsword</li>
    <li>Tiora Emberborn — Pyromancer</li>
    <li>Ser Calvess — Sword-Saint</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Type / Duration / Status / Reward:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Exploration • Combat • Puzzle</li>
    <li>⏳ Medium–Long</li>
    <li>✅ <strong>Completed</strong></li>
    <li>💰 600 gp + <em>Ancient Seals</em> (bonus marks of dwarven favor)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Objective:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Reach the sealed dwarven archive beneath the Saltstone Catacombs.</li>
    <li>Map tunnels for Guild records.</li>
    <li>Bypass ancient defenses.</li>
    <li>Collect dwarven stone-tablets.</li>
    <li>Return alive.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Summary:</h2>
  <p><strong>Descent & Mapping.</strong> The Ashen Blades entered via a collapsing mineshaft, ash and old smoke still clinging to the supports. Silas mapped precise turns while Korr carved physical markers. Pockets of poisonous salt-fog scoured lungs and steel.</p>

  <p><strong>Puzzles of Stone & Salt.</strong> At the first vault, three dwarven reliefs concealed salt-crystal lenses. Tiora’s heat nearly spider-cracked one, but her controlled flame lit a hidden glyph that revealed the pattern. Ser Calvess forced the final alignment, grinding stone rings until the door groaned open.</p>

  <p><strong>Combat in the Catacombs.</strong> Salt-ghouls (brine-twisted dwarven dead) ambushed the squad. Korr cleaved a rank with a single arc, Tiora’s blasts turned the tunnels into a furnace, and Calvess’ blade “whispered” with each strike. Silas took a shallow claw wound but pressed on.</p>

  <p><strong>The Rivalry Below.</strong> In the archive vault, a rival mercenary company already had the tablets in hand. A tense parley followed. Calvess refused to yield; Tiora pointed out the roof’s ominous settling. The rivals offered terms: they take the tablets; the Blades take the seals. The Blades—calculating the odds—agreed.</p>

  <p><strong>The Collapse.</strong> Saltstone began to shear and fall. Korr shouldered a beam long enough for the others to scramble out. They escaped scarred by ash and brine, map complete, seals secured—while the archive entombed itself behind them.</p>

  <h2>Outcome:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>✅ Archive reached; tunnels mapped; defenses bypassed.</li>
    <li>⚠️ <strong>Primary objective (Tablets):</strong> Lost to rival squad via negotiated concession.</li>
    <li>🏺 <strong>Secondary reward (Ancient Seals):</strong> Secured.</li>
    <li>⛏️ Catacombs collapsed—future recovery now <em>improbable</em>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Consequences:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Rival squad gains immediate dwarven favor; the Blades earn grudging respect for surviving and returning with Seals.</li>
    <li>Guild archives expanded with a full Saltstone map package.</li>
    <li>Reputation note: “Ruthless survivors” who can read a falling ceiling.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Rewards Issued:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>💰 600 gp (squad payout).</li>
    <li>🪙 <strong>3× Ancient Dwarven Seals</strong> — artifact-value markers useful in dwarven negotiations; redeemable for Guild Credit when invoked.</li>
    <li>📈 +1 Guild Reputation for mapping under hostile conditions.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 style="color: #5c3824;">MVP:</h2>
  <p><strong>🏆 Korr Blacktusk</strong> — Held the failing beam and kept the exit open while the team evacuated; without that stand, there would be no report to file.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2 style="color: #5c3824;">Tavern Rumors:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>“They came up from Saltstone coughing brine and smoke—like they’d drowned in fire.”</li>
    <li>“No tablets, aye, but seals that open vaults older than kings? I’d call that even.”</li>
    <li>“Another squad in the dark, voices raised—then the mountain answered.”</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 style="color: #5c3824;">Guildmaster’s Comment:</h2>
  <blockquote style="border-left: 4px solid #5c3824; margin: 1em; padding-left: 1em; font-style: italic;">
    “You traded pages for keys and lived to argue about it. Given the rocks overhead, I approve. File the maps, bank the seals, and send the rivals a bottle—empty, so they know how the roof felt.”
