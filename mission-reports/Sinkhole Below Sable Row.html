  <h2>Mission:</h2>
  <p>🕳️ <em>Operation Sable Maw (Sinkhole Below Sable Row)</em></p>

  <h2>Participants:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Vokkar</li>
    <li>Buggie</li>
    <li>ElderDan</li>
    <li>ObsidianIvy</li>
	<li>Styx-Red-Claw</li>
    <li>Tangy (Familiar)</li>
    <li>Russel (Animal Companion)</li>
  </ul>
<h2>Summary:</h2>
  <p>
    This mission began as a simple salvage op: check out a collapsed street, retrieve a wagon or two, and maybe discourage a few overenthusiastic sewer gators. Instead, our team descended into a tangled web of acidic tunnels, zombified coworkers, and extraplanar interference anchored by a very angry Akata nesting atop a pile of bones and bad decisions. We suspect the sinkhole may be less a geological failure and more a side effect of <strong>resonant void-warping</strong> - the sort of thing that happens when planar boundaries hiccup and reality forgets which direction is up.
  </p>

  <h2>Mission Log:</h2>

  <h3>🔍 Initial Descent:</h3>
  <p>
    The team began at the breach in Sable Row, noting odd clawed tracks descending into the debris. ObsidianIvy sent her familiar Lazlo down for recon. Lazlo hesitated—likely sensing the rodent-based horror below—but was ultimately persuaded with words and emotional bribery. Good bat.
  </p>
  <p>
    Within moments, the team engaged <strong>Giant Rats</strong>. The creatures, driven by desperation and perhaps more than a little hunger, swarmed from the shadows. They were dispatched with efficiency. Buggie’s reaction to rodentia remains classified as “aggressively alchemical.”
  </p>

  <h3>🍷 Wine Cellars & Minor Engineering Feats:</h3>
  <p>
    Descending further, the group entered what used to be a wine cellar—now a slick, acidic swamp of shattered glass and bad luck. ElderDan conducted an impromptu experiment in traction failure and became briefly acquainted with the floor.
  </p>
  <p>
    Vokkar, with ObsidianIvy’s guidance, constructed a makeshift walkway using shelving, rotted planks, and an impressive amount of silent judgment. Loot included a pair of <em>Sommelier’s Spectacles</em> and a Potion of Acid Resistance. Foreshadowing? Yes.
  </p>

  <h3>🪤 Sewer Level Unlocked:</h3>
  <p>
    Progressing through a corroded grate, the team entered the older Verge sewer system. Here they encountered <strong>Corrupted Giant Centipede</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The centipede showed signs of mutation and acid secretion, and no signs of hospitality. Vokkar ended the threat with a clean abdominal strike. Post-mortem: creature lacked a stomach. We have concerns.
  </p>
  <p>
    The remains of a previous retrieval team were also located—partial patches recovered, along with mild trauma and stronger resolve.
  </p>

  <h3>🧟 Aberrant Thralls & Tangy Trauma:</h3>
  <p>
    Advancing deeper, the group encountered <strong>Zombified Guilders</strong>. Yes, former Iron Meridian agents now reanimated and hostile. The confrontation was brutal and emotional—especially for Buggie, whose familiar Tangy sustained injury while heroically distracting the undead with snarling grace.
  </p>
  <p>
    ObsidianIvy’s and Buggie's rapid triage stabilized Tangy. The team recovered more Guild patches and gear from the fallen. All returned respectfully to HQ for ceremony.
  </p>

  <h3>💀 Final Chamber: The Akata Awakens:</h3>
  <p>
    At the final chamber, Vokkar attempted a stealthy approach. ElderDan’s enthusiasm overrode caution. Noise was made. The Akata emerged, dragging a nest of bones, cloth, and psychic energy in its wake.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Akata + Zombified Shamblers</strong> ensued. Mental assaults proved highly effective—Vokkar and Russel both succumbed briefly to mind control, attacking allies before regaining autonomy. The Akata drained life force from Vokkar during this phase, healing itself unnaturally.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the chaos, Vokkar spotted a greataxe embedded in the Akata’s nest: dark, humming, and covered in something unpleasant. He retrieved it mid-combat and turned it against the anomaly. The tide turned quickly thereafter. Akata eliminated. Shamblers collapsed.
  </p>

  <h2>Outcome:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>✅ Akata threat neutralized</li>
    <li>📦 Merchant cargo recovered</li>
    <li>🪓 Artifact-grade weapon ("Void-Eater’s Greataxe") retrieved</li>
    <li>🧟 Guild remains secured for burial honors</li>
    <li>🧪 Akata corpse preserved for further extraplanar research</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Notable Concerns:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The Void-Eater’s Greataxe is <em>not</em> just a weapon. Its presence in the nest, its resonance with the Akata, and the humming Vokkar heard all suggest planar significance. Further study suggested.</li>
    <li>The sinkhole may have been a symptom—not a cause. We suspect this site was a <strong>manifestation zone</strong> for extraplanar influence.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 style="color: #5c3824;">MVP:</h2>
  <p><strong>🏆 Vokkar</strong> - For resisting psychic control (eventually), engineering an impromptu bridge, and executing a mid-fight relic grab with style. Also for hitting things very hard when it mattered most.</p>

  <h2 style="color: #5c3824;">Guildmaster’s Comment:</h2>
  <blockquote style="border-left: 4px solid #5c3824; margin: 1em; padding-left: 1em; font-style: italic;">
    “A sinkhole filled with acid, mind-munching blue dogs, and undead coworkers. Classic salvage job. Extra credit to whoever decided ‘grab the humming axe’ was a valid strategy. Also, if Lazlo begins exhibiting planar leakage or glowing teeth, report immediately.”
