  <h2>Mission:</h2>
  <p>🌊 <em>The Affliction of the Redwater</em></p>

  <h2>Participants:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Buggie</li>
    <li>Vokkar</li>
    <li>Styx Red-Claw</li>
    <li>ElderDan</li>
    <li>Ecaon</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Summary:</h2>
  <p>The team was dispatched to the Redwater River to investigate a rather concerning issue: it was red. Deeply red. Suspiciously gloopy. And there were rumors of humming fish and mysterious singing at night.</p>

  <p>Upon arrival, they were greeted not with monsters but with... Bezza. A spirited washerwoman scrubbing away at her laundry like the river wasn’t actively plotting something. She was friendly, nosy, and coated in crimson suds. Her tale was filled with warnings of singing water, gravel-throated fish, and strangers in robes.</p>

  <p>heading to the river, the party arrived to find the water thick, crimson, and humming ominously. ElderDan, curious as ever, stuck his hands in first and reported tepid sludge, a weird vibration, and regret. Vokkar attempted a classic warrior prank by giving ElderDan a shove... and they both went in. What they learned was: the river clings. And possibly judges.</p>

  <p>The group followed gouges in the dirt which led them to a nearby lake. had a quick look and took note of its general ominousness before deciding to talk to Bezza again. They asked about local dwellings, and she pointed them toward two cottages that had recently gone quiet.</p>

  <p>Elara’s Cottage showed signs of magical protection and hasty departure. Inside, the group found a mysterious scroll, and three smooth grey stones etched with swirling runes. Ecaon, ever curious, read the scroll aloud. This went about as well as expected — he became convinced of a "Song of Awakening" and insisted they return to the lake immediately. Vokkar responded with swift, strategic violence (a punch), and the spell was broken with some magical aid.</p>

  <p>In Old Man Hemlock’s home, they found bizarre herbal tools, strange writings about “visions from the river,” and a collection of odd magical trinkets — including a night-scented unguent and a small, clockwork bird that Buggie traded with alric for something very magical.</p>

  <p>They continued their investigation along the riverbank and were suddenly beset by three giant crimson mosquitoes, bloated and buzzing with corrupted energy. These were swiftly dealt with.</p>

<p>At last returning to the lake for a full examination, Styx and ElderDan attempted a quiet approach to get a better look at the strange bubbling stone alter. Unfortunately, despite being aware of the presence of two slimes and an ooze, the moment didn't quite land — and the pair wandered in for a closer inspection like it was a picnic, not a potential ambush.</p>

<p>The area exploded into action. Slimes slithered, oozes gurgled, and the rest of the team (hearing the chaos from downshore) raced to join the fray. The battle was sticky, acidic, and altogether very squelchy. ElderDan’s robes will probably never smell the same. But the team prevailed, leaving behind sizzling puddles of what was once a gelatinous welcome committee.</p>

<p>Following the fight, the group turned their attention to a half-submerged altar. It featured five smooth indentations — four already filled with strange stones. The final indentation pulsed faintly. Recognizing the swirling runes from Elara’s cottage, the group carefully placed the last stone and and re-organised the others, with a satisfying hum and a shimmer of arcane light, deactivated the altar’s magic.</p>


  <p>What followed was unexpected: a sorrowful Siren emerged from the mist over the lake — a being of water, magic, and melancholy. Rather than fight, the team listened. They helped clear the area of corruption and debris, and the Siren, in return, spoke of dark-robed figures who had twisted the river’s magic, seeking to awaken something ancient and terrible. The stones were ritual keys. The altar a conduit. And the danger? Not over.</p>

  <p>The group returned with multiple samples and trinkets for Guild analysis. The strange energies matched prior traces found in goblin sigils — further tying these disturbances together.</p>

  <h2>Samples Collected:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Crimson Stirge parts (wings, proboscis, stingers)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Outcome:</h2>
  <p>The immediate source of the Redwater corruption was neutralized. The river has begun to clear, and its eerie song has faded. Several corrupted creatures were destroyed, key magical items recovered, and critical intelligence obtained regarding the cult responsible for the ritual.</p>

  <h2>Reward:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>💰 Full Guild Contract Reward Claimed</li>
    <li>🎵 Whispering Reed Flute (1/day <em>Message</em> across the river)</li>
    <li>🧪 Alchemical salvage and magical trinkets</li>
    <li>🤝 +1 Reputation with Riverfolk</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Next Steps:</h2>
  <p>Track down the black-robed cultists responsible for the ritual. Investigate the fate of Elara. Examine the locket and other items recovered from the ritual site. </p>

    “Cursed water, creepy lullabies, and cultists? Sounds like a Tuesday. Excellent initiative, solid punch decisions, and commendable restraint in not setting the lake on fire. Yet. Well done.”
