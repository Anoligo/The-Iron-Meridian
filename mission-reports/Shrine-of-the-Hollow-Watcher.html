  <h1 style="text-align: center; color: #4b2c20;">📜 Iron Meridian - Mission Report</h1>

  <h2>Mission:</h2>
  <p>⛰️ <em>Shrine of the Hollow Watcher</em></p>

  <h2>Participants:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Ecaon</li>
    <li>ObsidianIvy</li>
    <li>Styx Red-Claw</li>
    <li>Buggie</li>
    <li>Vokkar</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Summary:</h2>
  <p>The party arrived at Duskspine Ridge to assess a reported anomaly. After locating the shrine and speaking with Alder Renn, they discovered the way inward could be opened through stillness and contact, not sacrifice (though they did consider sacrificing Renn — briefly). Once inside, they braved a magical trap that punished noise, then solved a light-based puzzle to advance deeper.</p>

  <p>They fought off skeletal fanatics — during which Tangy, Buggie’s mountain lion companion, was wounded. Buggie, distraught, sent Tangy to safety. They encountered spectral figures and calmed them with words, before awakening the Echo of the Watcher via contact with an orb. Through communication and insight, the echo was dispelled.</p>

  <p>Deeper within, the group fought a dangerous trio: two Crypt Shades and a Ghoul Devotee. Ecaon was knocked unconscious and revived mid-battle by ObsidianIvy’s expert field medicine. Finally, in the Chamber of Supplication, the blood of Vokkar summoned the Aspect of the Hollow Watcher. They rejected its offer of silence and fought it until it returned to stone form. Placing the Momentary Token on the shrine disrupted the anomaly and granted a boon.</p>

  <p>Unhappy with the resolution, they rested and re-engaged the statue — initiating a second battle. The Aspect again turned to stone, and the group chose to destroy the statue entirely. This triggered a curse (-1 Diplomacy) and a full cavern collapse. They escaped with what they could — including the Vigilant Eye of Vash-Tul — but Alder Renn was missing. Behind them, the mountain collapsed.</p>

  <h2>Outcome:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>✅ Anomaly neutralized</li>
    <li>💎 Vigilant Eye of Vash-Tul recovered</li>
    <li>📍 Shrine destroyed; shrine access sealed by collapse</li>
    <li>❓ Alder Renn’s status unknown</li>
    <li>💢 Group cursed with –1 to Diplomacy checks</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Reward:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>💰 Artifact: Vigilant Eye of Vash-Tul</li>
    <li>🌟 XP Awarded: 400 XP per adventurer</li>
    <li>🩸 Boon: Permanent +1 bonus to saves vs. temporal effects</li>
  </ul>

    “Tried diplomacy. Tried blood. You covered all the classics. I’m torn between admiration and asking if the Watcher statue hit you first. That said, the mountain falling down was a bit much. Good instincts. Be ready for the consequences.”
